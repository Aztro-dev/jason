# Jason

This python module is inspired by a satirical discord message by Ray T. (The GOAT)

# Installation

In order to build this or whatever

```
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install maturin
maturin build
```

# Usage

`jason.Jason` is a class for your jasons

```py
from jason import Jason
jason = Jason(<annoying_value>)
```

You can then call `jason.annoying_value` to get jason's annoying value (duh)

There is also speak:

```py
from jason import speak
speak(<Any string you want>) # This may or may not just call println!
```
